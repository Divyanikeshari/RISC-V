# RISC-V

This project is an implementation of a pipelined RISC-V single-core processor, designed to improve instruction throughput over a basic single-cycle architecture.

It includes:

A five-stage pipelined architecture consisting of the stages:

**IF**: Instruction Fetch

**ID**: Instruction Decode / Register Fetch

**EX**: Execute / ALU Operations

**MEM**: Memory Access

**WB**: Write Back
